Hyacinth: A 19th Century Mountain Brush Set for Fantasy Maps
Version 1.0

This mountain-focused set is my first taken from 19th-Century sources, and as one would imagine, it's a hybrid of more modern styles paired with older topographical landforms. Based on an 1828 caravan map created by the archimandrite monk Nikita Bichurin who took on the monastic name "Hyacinth," the original map showed the road from Lhasa, Tibet, to Chengdu, China. One can see the remnants of the hill profile approach to elevation, but the landforms are beginning to adopt some of the aspects commonly found in hachure relief.
