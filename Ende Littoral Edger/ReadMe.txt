Ende: A 17th/18th Century Littoral Edger for Your Fantasy Maps
Version 1.0 - Designed for Photoshop

Ever since I put together my tutorial on replicating hatched 18th-century coastlines, I knew it was merely a stopgap. After all, the whole point of #NoBadMaps is to empower anyone to create high-quality historically-infused maps quickly and efficiently. While following along through complex Photoshop procedures can get you there, it still takes a bit more effort than I wanted.

To that end, I've released the next iteration of the hatched coastline—Ende—a totally-free brush set where you can just paint-in your hatches. No longer do you have to go through multiple panels to get what you want. If you can draw a line, you can hatch in your littoral edges. Simple as that.

More details on this set and other brushes can be found at kmalexander.com.

Thanks for download this brush set, and I hope you find them useful.
